<p>Getting started should cover everything developers will need to get up and running with an API. After finishing your API, and you think it is ready for prime time, grab someone who knows nothing about the API, and watch them try to use it. Use what you learn to craft a simple opening paragraph, then some steps users can follow:</p>

<p>Here are some steps to get started:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Register for an API account</li>
	<li>Use Github, Twitter, or LinkedIn Auth</li>
	<li>Visit our API documentation page</li>
	<li>Visit our code page, and download the language library you need</li>
	<li>Import postman collections into your postman if you need to play further</li>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/api-commons/api-portal/issues">Submit a Github issue for the master repository</a></li>
</ol>

<p>You should close up your getting started steps with some other helpful information. Depending on the other building blocks you offer as part of API operations, you can provide links to other existing resources.</p>
<p>If there is anything I can make smoother, or left out, please let me know.</p>
