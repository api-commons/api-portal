    The University of Washington was one of the earliest higher education
    institutions I started tracking on with my API research. While it hasn't
    changed in the last couple years, it has seemed to grow in inventory of
    APIs. The effort is still a very IT led, web services effort, but I think it
    has a lot of promise.

    Brigham Young University has the most APIs I've come across with any of my
    university research. While many are still SOAP services, they are actively
    working to evolve them. BYU is also leading the conversation when it comes
    to university API design, and holding university API conferences, bringing
    together other institutions together to share API knowledge.
